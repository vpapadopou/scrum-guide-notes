\section*{Agile Software Development}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A different approach to the software development process
	\item Focuses on the clean delivery of individual pieces or parts of the software and \textbf{not} on the entire application
	\item Requirements \& solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of teams and their customers and/or end users
	\item Encourages \textit{early delivery} and \textit{continuous improvement}
	\item The term Agile was popularized in 2001 when the \textit{Agile Manifesto} was published
\end{itemize}

\section*{Agile Manifesto}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Individuals and interactions}\\
	over processes and tools
	\item \textbf{Working software}\\
	over comprehensive documentation
	\item \textbf{Customer collaboration}\\
	over contract negotiation
	\item \textbf{Responding to change}\\
	over following a plan
\end{itemize}

\section*{Definition of Scrum}
\textit{Scrum (n): A \textbf{framework} within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.}

\section*{What is a framework?}
A framework is a system of rules, ideas, or beliefs that is used to plan or decide something.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!8!white,colframe=gray!50!black,title=Note,sharp corners,fonttitle=\normalsize\bfseries,fontupper=\normalsize,left=0.7em,right=0.7em]
	As a framework, Scrum will never provide you with exact processes or show you exactly how to deal with problems. Instead, it provides a set of rules and relies on the team to find the best possible solution
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Concept}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Small team of people that is highly \textit{flexible} and \textit{adaptive}
	\item Employ an iterative, incremental approach to \textit{optimize predictability} and \textit{control risk}
	\item Make decisions based on empirical process control theory, or \textit{empiricism}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Empiricism}
\textit{Knowledge comes from experience and making decisions on what is known.}

\section*{Scrum Consists of}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Roles
	\item Events
	\item Artifacts
	\item Rules
\end{itemize}

\section*{Scrum Optimizes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Flexibility
	\item Creativity
	\item Productivity
\end{itemize}

\section*{Three Pillars of Scrum}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Transparency}\\
	Make significant aspects of the process visible to those responsible for the outcome
	\item \textbf{Inspection}\\
	Frequently inspect the progress towards a goal to detect undesirable variances
	\item \textbf{Adaption}\\
	Adjust the process as soon as possible to minimize further deviation
\end{itemize}

\section*{Scrum Values}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Commitment}\\
    People personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team
    \item \textbf{Courage}\\
    The Scrum Team members have courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems
    \item \textbf{Focus}\\
    Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team
    \item \textbf{Openness}\\
    The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work
    \item \textbf{Respect}\\
    Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people
\end{itemize}

\section*{The Scrum Team}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Product Owner
    \item Development Team
    \item Scrum Master
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!8!white,colframe=gray!50!black,title=Note,sharp corners,fonttitle=\normalsize\bfseries,fontupper=\normalsize,left=0.7em,right=0.7em]
	Be careful not to confuse the \textit{Scrum Team} with the \textit{Development Team}. The Scrum Team contains the Development Team, along with the Product Owner and the Scrum Master
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Scrum Team Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Deliver products \textit{iteratively} and \textit{incrementally}
	\item Self-organizing
	\item Cross-functional
\end{itemize}

\section*{Self-organization}
\textit{Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team.}

\section*{Cross-functionality}
\textit{Cross-functional teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team.}

\section*{The Product Owner}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from work of the Development Team
	\item One person, not a committee
    \item The \textbf{only} person responsible for managing the \textit{Product Backlog}. They have the final say on its content and ordering and \textit{everyone} must respect their decisions
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!8!white,colframe=gray!50!black,title=Note,sharp corners,fonttitle=\normalsize\bfseries,fontupper=\normalsize,left=0.7em,right=0.7em]
	The Product Owner may have the Development Team or someone else manage the Product Backlog. They, however, remain \textbf{accountable}
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Product Backlog}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A \textit{prioritized} list of desired product functionality
	\item Provides a shared understanding of what is needed in the product and in which order
\end{itemize}

\section*{Product Owner - Product Backlog}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clearly express Product Backlog Items
    \item Order the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions
    \item Optimize the value of work the Development Team performs
    \item Ensure that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, clear to all and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next
    \item Ensure that the Development Team understands the Product Backlog to the level needed
\end{itemize}

\section*{The Development Team}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a \textit{potentially releasable} Increment of ``Done'' product at the end of each Sprint
	\item Only members of the Development Team create the Increment
    \item Size: 3 to 9 members
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!8!white,colframe=gray!50!black,title=Note,sharp corners,fonttitle=\normalsize\bfseries,fontupper=\normalsize,left=0.7em,right=0.7em]
	The Scrum Guide \textit{suggests} to have a Development Team of 3 to 9 members but this is not a \textit{requirement}. A Development Team can still have 15 members however, it won't be as effective.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Development Team Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Self-organizing
    \item Cross-functional
	\item Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members
	\item Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team
	\item Accountability belongs to the \textbf{team} as a whole
\end{itemize}

\section*{The Scrum Master}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Promotes and supports Scrum
    \item Helps everyone understand Scrum theory, practices and rules 
    \item Acts as a \textit{Servant-Leader} for the Scrum Team
    \item Helps those outside the Scrum Team understand which interactions are helpful and which aren't
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!8!white,colframe=gray!50!black,title=Note,sharp corners,fonttitle=\normalsize\bfseries,fontupper=\normalsize,left=0.7em,right=0.7em]
	As servant-leader the Scrum Master guides and coaches the Scrum Team. They are not allowed, however, to tell the team what to do or how to do it unless related to the Scrum framework
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Scrum Master - Product Owner}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ensure that goals, scope, and product domain are understood by everyone on the Scrum Team as well as possible
    \item Find techniques for effective Product Backlog management
    \item Help the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog Items
    \item Ensure the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value
    \item Understand product planning in an empirical environment
    \item Understand and practice agility
    \item Facilitate Scrum events as requested or needed
\end{itemize}

\section*{Scrum Master - Development Team}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Coach the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality
    \item Help the Development Team create high-value products
    \item Remove impediments to the Development Team's progress
    \item Facilitate Scrum events as requested or needed
    \item Coach the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood
\end{itemize}

\section*{Scrum Master - Organization}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lead and coach the organization in its Scrum adoption
    \item Plan Scrum implementations within the organization
    \item Help employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product development
    \item Cause change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team
    \item Work with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum in the organization
\end{itemize}

\section*{Scrum Events}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Sprint
	\item Sprint Planning
	\item Daily Scrum
	\item Sprint Review
	\item Sprint Retrospective
\end{itemize}

\section*{Scrum Event Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create regularity
	\item Minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum
	\item Time-boxed (have max duration)
	\item Each event is an opportunity to inspect and adapt something
	\item Failure to include any of these events results in reduced transparency
\end{itemize}

\section*{The Sprint}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Acts as a container for all other events
	\item Duration: One month or less (consistent duration)
	\item A new sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint
	\item A ``Done'', potentially releasable Product Increment is created
	\item Consists of:
	\vspace{-0.5em}
    \begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{0em}
        \item Sprint Planning
        \item Daily Scrums
        \item Development Work
        \item Sprint Review
        \item Sprint Retrospective
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{During the Sprint}
\begin{itemize}
    \item No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
	\item Quality goals do not decrease
	\item Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and the Development Team as more is learned
\end{itemize}

\section*{Cancelling a Sprint}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Only} the Product Owner has the authority to cancel a Sprint
	\item The Sprint is cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes \textit{obsolete}
	\item Any completed and ``Done'' Product Backlog items are reviewed
    \item If part of the work is potentially releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts it
    \item All incomplete Product Backlog Items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!8!white,colframe=gray!50!black,title=Note,sharp corners,fonttitle=\normalsize\bfseries,fontupper=\normalsize,left=0.7em,right=0.7em]
	Sprint cancellations are often traumatic to the Scrum Team and should be avoided. They also consume resources as everyone regroups in another Sprint Planning to start another Sprint.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Sprint Planning}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
	\item How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?
	\item The plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team
	\item Max duration: 8 hours for one-month Sprint
	\item Attendees: All Scrum Team members
\end{itemize}

\section*{Sprint Planning - Input}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Product Backlog
    \item Latest Product Increment
    \item Projected capacity of the Development Team during the Sprint
    \item Past Performance of the Development Team
\end{itemize}

\section*{Sprint Planning - Notes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The number of items selected from the Product Backlog for the Sprint is \textbf{solely} up to the Development Team
	\item The Product Owner can help to clarify selected Product Backlog Items and make trade-offs
	\item The Development Team may renegotiate selected Product Backlog Items with the Product Owner
	\item The Development Team may invite other people to attend to provide technical or domain advice
	\item Output: \textit{Sprint Backlog} and \textit{Sprint Goal}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Sprint Backlog}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Product Backlog Items selected for this Sprint
    \item A plan for delivering them
\end{itemize}

\section*{Sprint Goal}
\begin{itemize}
    \item An \textbf{objective} that will be met within the Sprint through the implementation of the selected Product Backlog Items
    \item Provides guidance to the Development Team on \textit{why} it is building the Increment
    \item Created by the entire Scrum Team
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!8!white,colframe=gray!50!black,title=Note,sharp corners,fonttitle=\normalsize\bfseries,fontupper=\normalsize,left=0.7em,right=0.7em]
	Although Sprint Planning starts by having the Product Owner discuss the objective that the Sprint should achieve and the Product backlog Items that, if completed during the Sprint, would achieve the Sprint Goal, the final Sprint Goal is created by the collaborative effort of the entire Scrum Team
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Daily Scrum}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Held every day of the Sprint at the same place and time
    \item The Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours
	\item Max duration: 15 minutes
	\item Attendees: All Development Team members
\end{itemize}

\section*{Daily Scrum - Notes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The Scrum Master ensures that the Development Team has the meeting but the Development Team is \textbf{responsible for conducting} the Daily Scrum
	\item The Scrum Master teaches the team to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15-minute time-box
	\item The Development Team or team members often meet immediately after the Daily Scrum for related discussions
    \item It is an internal meeting for the Development Team. If others are present, the Scrum Master ensures they \textbf{do not disrupt} the meeting
\end{itemize}

\section*{Daily Scrum - Benefits}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Improve communications
	\item Eliminate other meetings
	\item Identify impediments to development for removal
	\item Highlight and promote quick decision-making
	\item Improve the Development Team's level of knowledge
\end{itemize}

\section*{Sprint Review}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Held at the end of each Sprint
	\item Inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed
	\item Collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value
	\item Max duration: 4 hours for a one-month Sprint
	\item Attendees: All Scrum Team members and Stakeholders\\
	(Invited by the Product Owner)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Sprint Review - Notes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The Sprint Review is \textbf{not a demo}
	\item The presentation of the Increment is intended to elicit feedback and foster collaboration
	\item Output: A revised Product Backlog that defines the \textit{probable} Product Backlog Items for the next Sprint
\end{itemize}

\section*{Scrum Master - Sprint Review}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ensure that the event takes place
	\item Everyone should understand its purpose
	\item Teach everyone to keep it within the time-limit
\end{itemize}

\section*{Sprint Retrospective}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning
	\item Identify how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, processes and tools
	\item Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements
	\item Create a \textit{plan} for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work
	\item Max duration: 3 hours for a one-month Sprint
	\item Attendees: All Scrum Team members
\end{itemize}

\section*{Scrum Master - Sprint Retrospective}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ensure that the event takes place and attendants understand its purpose
	\item Ensure that the meeting is \textit{positive} and \textit{productive}
	\item Teach everyone to keep it within the time-box
	\item Participate as peer team member from the accountability over the Scrum process
	\item Encourage the Scrum Team to improve
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!8!white,colframe=gray!50!black,title=Note,sharp corners,fonttitle=\normalsize\bfseries,fontupper=\normalsize,left=0.7em,right=0.7em]
	During each Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team plans ways to increase product quality by improving work processes or adapting the definition of ``Done'' if appropriate and not in conflict with the product or organizational standards
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Scrum Artifacts}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Product Backlog
	\item Sprint Backlog
	\item Increment
\end{itemize}

\section*{Product Backlog}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ordered list of everything known to be needed in the Product
	\item Single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the Product
	\item Dynamic (it evolves)
	\item It is never complete
	\item If a Product exists, a Product Backlog exists too
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!8!white,colframe=gray!50!black,title=Note,sharp corners,fonttitle=\normalsize\bfseries,fontupper=\normalsize,left=0.7em,right=0.7em]
	If multiple Scrum Teams work on the same Product, \textbf{only one} Product Backlog is used
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Product Backlog Items}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Product Backlog items that will occupy the Development Team for the upcoming Sprint are \textit{refined} so that any one item can reasonably be ``Done'' within the Sprint
    \item Product Backlog items that can be ``Done'' by the Development Team within one Sprint are deemed ``Ready'' for selection in a Sprint Planning
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!8!white,colframe=gray!50!black,title=Note,sharp corners,fonttitle=\normalsize\bfseries,fontupper=\normalsize,left=0.7em,right=0.7em]
	Product Backlog Items can be updated \textit{anytime} by the Product Owner or at the Product Owner's discretion
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Product Backlog Items - Attributes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Description
    \item Order
    \item Estimate
    \item Value
    \item May also include test descriptions that will prove the item's completeness when ``Done''
\end{itemize}

\section*{Product Backlog Refinement}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The act of adding \textbf{detail}, \textbf{estimates}, and \textbf{order} to items in the Product Backlog
	\item The Product Owner and the Development Team cooperate during refinement
	\item The Scrum Team decides \textit{how} and \textit{when} refinement is done
	\item \textit{Usually} consumes no more than 10\% of the Development Team's capacity
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!8!white,colframe=gray!50!black,title=Note,sharp corners,fonttitle=\normalsize\bfseries,fontupper=\normalsize,left=0.7em,right=0.7em]
	It is the sole responsibility of the Development Team to estimate items in the Product Backlog. Although the Product Owner may influence the team by helping it understand and select trade-offs, the people who will perform the work make the final estimate
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Sprint Backlog}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The set of Product Backlog Items selected for the Sprint
	\item A plan for delivering the Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal
	\item Includes at least one high priority process improvement identified in the previous Retrospective meeting
	\item Belongs \textbf{solely} to the Development Team. Only they can change it during a Sprint
\end{itemize}

\section*{Increment}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The sum of all Product Backlog Items completed during the Sprint and the value of Increments of all previous Sprints
	\item A step towards a vision or a goal
	\item Must be in \textit{usable condition} regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to release it
\end{itemize}

\section*{Definition of ``Done''}
\begin{itemize}
	\item When a Product Backlog Item or an Increment is described as ``Done'', everyone must understand what ``Done'' means
	\item The definition of ``Done'' is used to assess when work is complete on the product Increment
    \item Guides the Development Team in knowing how many Product Backlog Items it can select during a Sprint Planning
\end{itemize}

\section*{Definition of ``Done'' - Notes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multiple Scrum Teams working on the same Product \textbf{must} mutually define the definition of ``Done''
    \item If the definition of ``Done'' is part of the conventions, standards or guidelines of the development organization, all Scrum Teams \textbf{must} follow it as a \textit{minimum}
	\item As Scrum Teams mature, it is expected that their definitions of ``Done'' will expand to include more stringent criteria for higher quality
	\item A new Definition of ``Done'', as used, may uncover work to be done in previously ``Done'' Increments
\end{itemize}

\section*{Sprint Progress}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textit{Development Team} tracks the total work remaining in the Sprint Backlog at least every \textbf{Daily Scrum}
    \item Helps evaluate the likelihood of achieving the Sprint Goal
\end{itemize}

\section*{Release Progress}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textit{Product Owner} tracks the total work remaining to reach a goal at least every \textbf{Sprint Review}
    \item They compare this amount with work remaining at previous Sprint Reviews to assess progress toward completing projected work
\end{itemize}
