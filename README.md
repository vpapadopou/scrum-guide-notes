### Description

A collection of notes on the Scrum Guide. Organized in bullet point format, these can help you better understand the key concepts of Scrum and highlight important points. I also found them extremely useful while preparing for the Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification. It is highly recommended, however, that you read the Scrum Guide first to obtain a complete understanding of the Scrum framework.

Based on the November 2017 version of the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/)

*Note: The only reliable source of information for Scrum is the official Scrum Guide. You should always double check everything you read here with the official Scrum guide as changes might have been made or I might have not understood something completely.*
